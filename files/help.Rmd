# Interactive tool for production validation

1. Open a session in the "agriculture production" of the LIVE environment:
   https://intranet-sws.fao.org/sws/

1. Choose:
   - **ONE** country
   - elements 5510, 5312 and 5421 (production, area harvested, and yield, respectively, all or just one of them)
   - relevant commodities/years (even just one commodity and one year)

   ![Query][query]

1. Choose "Run plugin" in the upper right corner of your session.

   ![Run plugin][run]

1. Choose the `production_validation` plugin, select the item type and click on "Get debug token".
   
   ![Get token][gentoken]
   
1. Copy the token that appears in the popup (a string like abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef123456789).

   ![Copy token][token]

1. Paste the token in the upper left input field in this tool (where it says "Token in agriculture production dataset").

   ![Paste token][usetoken]

1. Wait until you see the outlier table in the "Outliers" tab (if you're not on it, you'll need to select the tab to see the results). The table shows the items with outliers in at least one element/year in the validation years, differentiated by element (e.g., if in the "area" column says "true", it means that there is at least one identified outlier in the "area" element).

   ![Tab outliers][taboutliers]

1. Select (i.e., click on) one of the items in the "Outliers" table (they are sorted by the average weight in tons in 2010-2013).

1. Analyze the plot that will automatically open in the "Plots" tab

   ![Tab plots][tabplots]

1. Once you figure out what to do with the outlier(s):
   - If the outliers do not need to be fixed/removed, click in the "Looks fine" button. They will be removed from the outliers list.
   - If the outiers need attention:
     - If you want to remove the value, click on the _row_ of the observation you want to remove and click on "Clean series" button
     - _(NOTE: this is doable, but not recommended: just remove the outlier)_ If you want to modify the value, click on the figure you want to fix, insert a new number and modify flags accordingly (modified values will be signaled by a red background)

1. When no outliers remain, you can generate a report by clicking on "Generate report".
  
**NOTE**: use "Looks fine" or "Save current data" just once: as you use one of these two, the item will be marked as fixed and removed from the list of outliers, so you will not be able to see it again (in this case, you should start again).
